Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the hot skillet. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side.

As the eggs begin to set but are still slightly runny on top, add your desired fillings, such as shredded cheese, diced ham, sautéed vegetables, or fresh herbs. Fold one side of the omelet over the fillings, and cook for another 30 seconds to a minute until the eggs are fully set. Slide the omelet onto a plate and serve hot.
