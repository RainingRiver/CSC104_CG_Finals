Tasty Treasure - Recipe Website

Description:
This webpage, titled "Tasty Treasure," is a simple recipe website designed to display different recipes based on user selection. When the user first visits the website, they see the title "Tasty Treasure" centered at the top of the page. Below the title, a thick horizontal line separates the header from the main content.

The main content area includes:
1. Navigation Buttons: Four buttons labeled "Breakfast," "Lunch," "Dinner," and "Dessert." These buttons allow the user to filter recipes by meal type. When clicked, the page dynamically updates to display recipes for the selected category.
2. Recipe Display: Four recipe boxes are shown vertically beneath the buttons. Each box contains the name of the recipe and a brief set of instructions on how to prepare the dish.

Upon opening the website, the user sees one recipe from each category (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert) displayed in the recipe boxes. This provides a quick preview of the variety of recipes available on the site.

Interaction:
- Clicking on a navigation button updates the recipe boxes to show all recipes within the chosen category.
